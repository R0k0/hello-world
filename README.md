Testing GitHub

Hi, visitors!

I am Roko Medančić. Searching the internet I found FreeCodeCamp.
I heard that before you finish all challenges you get job. Since FCC is free I started to learn on FCC web-site.
Now I am on Zipline. In Zipline challenges you need to create web-page from scratch.
Since we need to create GitHub account if we want to chat on Gitter. Gitter is chat for developers.
GitHub will be useful for storing images for use image link.
Till now I did not know how to use GitHub, but now I learning.
I am very happy that I found FreeCodeCamp, even I am not beginner in programming.
I know a little from before about basic of HTML, CSS, JS, JAVA, VB, VBA, C.
